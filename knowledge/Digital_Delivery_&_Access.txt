## **Delivery Speed**

All games are delivered digitally **instantly** upon successful purchase.  
There is no physical shipping process, so you can begin downloading and playing your game immediately after checkout is complete.

## **How to Access Your Games**

Once a game is purchased, it is permanently added to your personal **Game Library** associated with your GameVerse account.

### **Downloading**
To download a game, navigate to your Library, select the game, and click the **"Install"** or **"Download"** button.

### **Offline Play**
Most single-player games can be played **offline** after the initial download and necessary verification.  
Check the specific game's requirements for details.

### **Lost Purchases**
If you lose access to your account or need to reinstall a game, your purchase history is secure.  
Simply log in, and your entire library will be available for re-download at any time.

## **Pre-Orders**

If you purchase a pre-order, the game will be added to your Library immediately, but the **"Install"** button will only become active on the official release date.  
You will typically be able to **pre-load** the game a day or two before release.
